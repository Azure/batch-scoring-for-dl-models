    "# 6. Deploy and Test Logic Apps\n",
    "Now that we've verified that our Docker image works, this notebook will walk through how to operationalize this workflow using [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this workflow, adding a file whose name begins with 'trigger' will kick-off the entire batch style transfer process. In this architecture, we use Logic App as our trigger mechanism: when a trigger file (ex. 'trigger.txt') is uploaded into blob storage, Logic App will detect that the file has been added, and create an [Azure Container Instance (ACI)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/) to start creating Batch AI jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will rely on the file __template.logic_app.json__ to deploy the Logic App. This file is a template for a [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) json file, which we will use in this notebook to deploy the resources. In its current state, this file does not contain any of the parameters, such as those stored in the .env file, that we've set throughout the tutorial. To fill out those parameters, we will use [jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) to populate the template with all the appropriate parameters and write the output to __logic_app.json__. This will be ARM json file that we use with the __az cli__ to deploy the Logic App.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Logic App deployment, we'll also deploy 2 additional resources: an Azure blob storage connector and an ACI connector. These connectors will allow Logic App to talk to these two resources."

At this point, I'd encourage you to take a look through the portal and examine the individual components of the architecture and make sure that all the parts are operating as expected. For further customization, you can also edit the Logic App via the Logic App Designer (in the portal) so that the triggering mechanism is more fitted to your scenarios.\n",
